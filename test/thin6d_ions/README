Tests:
- thin6d test based on LHC lattice with ELEN inserted at IP4.
- machine set for Pb ions, 450 Z GeV;

Test tracks 18 particles for 10k turns:
- 6 protons, 6 Xe ions, 6 Pb ions;
- for each species:
  - 2 on-momentum particles, with ~0 and ~6sig (30degs on xy-plane) amplitude;
  - 2 off-momentum particles, with same starting conditions (betatron) and -2*sigdpp;
  - 2 off-momentum particles, with same starting conditions (betatron) and +2*sigdpp;

Manual check:
- all particles are dumped at the first turn at every element;
- all particles are dumped at the first element at every turn;
The python script shows the output of the two dumps.
