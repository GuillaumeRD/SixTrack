Based on test elensidealthin4d

Tests DUMP and FMA with normalized coordinates and physical coordinates in the case of 4d tracking. Normalization should be only allowed in DUMP and FMA in the following cases:
- only for StartDUMP (in this case the matrix is taken from the initial optics calculation for the initialization of the particles - tas matrix). For all other elements the tas matrix is taken from the LINE block -> not allowed/checked for 4D.
- not allowed for momentum scan and 4D. Use 6d in this case.
