SixTrack supports interfacing with external libraries and simulation tools.
This chapter describes how to use these tools with SixTrack.

\section{Pythia Integration} \label{ExtPythia}

Pythia8 is ``a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state''~\cite{pythia8}\index{Pythia}.
Version 8 is rewritten in c++ as a library, which makes it suitable for direct integration into SixTrack 5 via the update and extended c-interface available in Fortran2008.
The integration was made specifically for the Scatter module\index{scatter} to function as an event generator for single diffractive scattering.

The Pythia8 library is built using the \texttt{buildLibraries.sh} script, and linking with SixTrack is provided with the \texttt{PYTHIA} compiler flag\index{build}.
When the \texttt{PYTHIA} block is present in \texttt{fort.3}, a new generator becomes available to the Scatter module.
